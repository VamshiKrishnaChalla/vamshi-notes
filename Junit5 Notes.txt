-------------------------------------------------
Junit is a unit testing framework for the Java. It plays important role for test-driven development.

Why do we need testing?

The point of writing the test cases for application is to verify the ongoing execution of the program/application which continues to work in the future.

Testing Procedure

Preparation
Provide Test inputs
Run the tests
Provide expected output
Verify the result
If fails -> Alert the Dev.

Junit Framework provides API for easing out the dev to manually wite the elaborate test cases

Dev just need to provide Test inputs, expected output and running the test. Junit framework will verify the result and alert dev of test case fails

Annotations:

@Test: Method which is to be run as test case.
Assertions.asseertEquals -> Provides method which are used to compare the Actual valule of application to the expected result

Like in Normal Java file, JVM Searches with main() method, JVM searches @Test annotation for executing the test cases (it is starting point)

Life Cycle Hooks
---------------
@BeforeAll: Runs before all test case or once for a class
It needs an instance to run the method with @BeforeAll annotation, So wothout static JVM can't run this method unless add static before method signature. Static method doesn't need any instance to run.
 - Add static as it runs while loading the class or,
 - @TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS): Annotates to class, Creates an instance of test class
	It'll run @BeforeAll/@AfterAll without adding method as static

@AfterAll: Runs After all test case or once for a class
@BeforeEach: Runs before running each test cases
@AfterEach: Runs after running each test cases
--------------
@DisplayName: To add proper name of test case
@Disabled: To disable particular test case
